# Code-Refactor

## Description
Formatted the html and eliminated some unnecessary elements that were duplicated throughout the code and the stylesheet.  Also added some alternate text to images and icons to be better accessible to everyone. 
- My motivation was make sure that the website was accessible to anyone who wanted to use it. 
- The client reached out for help and I wanted to help them solve the issues. 
- The site is now fully acessible. 
- Coding takes a lot of detail work to make everything just so.
